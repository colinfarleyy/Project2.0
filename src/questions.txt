What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
    Part A was by far the hardest part of this project. I kept having this bug where the computer would play twice
    and then not play for a turn, and then play twice. It ended up being an issue where I was updating the turn twice,
    thus the computer would get skipped and then called twice.
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Donâ€™t include readings, lectures, and exercises, but do
include any help from other sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends) and attribute
them by name.
    The pseudocode was extremely helpful.
Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
    The biggest issue I had with this project was time. I had multiple exams and projects due around the same time
    so I didn't have very much time to work on this, so I used my extension.
Explain your heuristic that you invented for Part C.
    The heuristic essentially evaluates all pieces from both players, decides who is winning.Then, it calculates the
    all the possible moves, however many moves in advance. And makes is move based on that.
List any other feedback you have. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment,
and whether you enjoyed doing it.
    A very cool project. I actually bet my roommate $10 he couldnt beat my program in 10 tries. (I won)
